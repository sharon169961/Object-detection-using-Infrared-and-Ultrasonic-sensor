# Ultrasonic and Infrared Sensor with Arduino Uno

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use both an ultrasonic sensor and an infrared (IR) sensor with an Arduino Uno. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of objects, while the IR sensor is used for obstacle detection or line-following applications.

## Components Needed

- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Infrared Sensor (IR module)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- 5V Power Supply

## Pin Configuration

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- **VCC** → 5V on Arduino
- **GND** → GND on Arduino
- **Trig** → Pin 9 on Arduino
- **Echo** → Pin 10 on Arduino

### Infrared Sensor (IR module)
- **VCC** → 5V on Arduino
- **GND** → GND on Arduino
- **OUT** → Pin 8 on Arduino

## Wiring Diagram

1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor's `VCC` pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
2. Connect the ultrasonic sensor's `GND` pin to the GND pin on the Arduino.
3. Connect the `Trig` pin of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 9 on the Arduino.
4. Connect the `Echo` pin of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 10 on the Arduino.
5. Connect the infrared sensor's `VCC` pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
6. Connect the infrared sensor's `GND` pin to the GND pin on the Arduino.
7. Connect the `OUT` pin of the infrared sensor to pin 8 on the Arduino.



## Working

- The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the nearest object by emitting sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to reflect back.
- The IR sensor detects the presence of an object or obstacle based on infrared light reflection.

## How to Use

1. Connect the components to the Arduino Uno as described above.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to observe the distance readings from the ultrasonic sensor and the status of the IR sensor (whether it detects an obstacle or not).

## Applications

- **Distance Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor can be used to measure the distance between the sensor and an object.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The IR sensor can be used to detect obstacles in a robot's path for applications like line-following or collision avoidance.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all connections are secure and correct.
- Verify that the sensor is working by checking the output on the Serial Monitor.
- If you encounter problems, try adjusting the wiring or re-uploading the code.
